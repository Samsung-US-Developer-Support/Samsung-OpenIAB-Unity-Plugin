OpenIAB Plugin. Open In-App Billing for Android, iOS and Windows Phone 8
====================

##Releases
The latest build is always available [here] (https://github.com/onepf/OpenIAB/releases).

##About
Supporting in-app purchases for different platforms and stores is not a simple process. The developer has to study new API for each new store that he/she wants to use in an application.<br /><br />
OpenIAB plugin enables Unity developers to reduce integration and maintenance time. The plugin uses one common interface for 3 mobile platforms: Android, iOS and Windows Phone 8. It’s based on [OpenIAB library](https://github.com/onepf/OpenIAB "OpenIAB") developed by One Platform Foundation team. <br /><br />
OpenIAB plugin comes with full source code under Apache 2.0 license.<br /><br />
