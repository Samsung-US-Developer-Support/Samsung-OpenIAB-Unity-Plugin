	- This menu allows users to modify the OpenIAB options of the CityFlyer sample application
	at runtime to affect the behavior of the Appstore selection algorithm. For more 
	information on each of the options, please refer to the Options class	in the documentation.
	
	- Normally, this screen should not be available to end users and is useful for
	testing purposes only.
	
	- A quick usage guide is shown below:
	
		> For Samsung Appstore:
			- Uncheck "Check Inventory"
			- Set search strategy to "Best Fit"
			- Check "Force Samsung"
			- Choose any of the Samsung IAP Modes
			- Launch Game
		
		> For Google Appstore (Method 1):
			- Sideload the apk with "adb install -r -i com.android.vending CityIAP_RC3.0.apk"
			- Set search strategy to "Installer" or "Installer then Best Fit"
			- Launch Game
			
		> For Google Appstore (Method 2):
			- Install the apk without any appstore packages
			- Set search strategy to "Best Fit"
			- Check "Google"
			- Launch Game
			
		> For Amazon Appstore:
			- Make sure Amazon Underground is installed in the device
			- Add amazon.sdktester.json found in Samsung-OpenIAB-Unity-Plugin\OpenIAB\library  to \mnt\sdcard on the device
